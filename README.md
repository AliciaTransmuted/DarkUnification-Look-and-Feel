DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel notes
---------------------------------------------

April 21, 2019: Initial 0.1 release of DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel to github
- Dependencies: sed
- photos Locked and Wilted are my own work
- this is my first attempt at a complete Plasma 5 Look and Feel theme with a Bash Script installer so there may be issues
- the first time it is used there are several KDE Plasma artifacts to download and install... please be patient
- launch the installer in your favorite terminal... sh install.sh
