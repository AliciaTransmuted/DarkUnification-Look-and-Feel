- Dependencies: sed tar
- Download and extract anywhere in to your home directory... eg. under ~/Downloads
- From your favorite terminal emulator, launch install.sh
- E.G. say you extracted to ~/Downloads/DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-master/DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel
- Running:
- sh Downloads/DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-master/DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel/install.sh

- will both work
- images face, Locked and Wilted are my own work
