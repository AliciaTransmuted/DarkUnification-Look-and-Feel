# DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-with-Install-Script

A dark Plasma 5 Look and Feel theme with red highlights, loosely in the style of the Ubuntu Unity desktop, including a shell script to backup KDE config files, set up all wallpapers and KDE settings.

THIS PROJECT IS READY TO BE USED and/or TESTED
- Ensure your file manager is set to view Hidden Files to see backup files
- You may have to reapply the DarkUnification Look and Feel once more after installation/reboot

You may now also download the "DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-Theme" directly from the KDE Plasma System Settings application.

- this is my first attempt at a complete Plasma 5 Look and Feel theme with a Bash Script installer so there may be issues
- the first time it is used there are several KDE Plasma artifacts to download and install, so please be patient

June 8, 2019: Renamed git repository to "DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-with-Install-Script" to better differenciatte it from the standard "DarkUnification-Look-and-Feel-Theme" repository.
